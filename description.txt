Adds achievements for player difficulties to the in-game list.

## Additions
Hardestcore is a new difficulty that is enabled when a Hardcore player is in a world that no player has died in. In other words, you can't create a new Hardcore player to continue in a world that you previously died in.

## Restrictions
- Enforced Progression (e.g. you can't use post-Moon Lord items before defeating Moon Lord, etc.)
- No Journey Mode
- No Celebrationmk10 Seed

## Notes
Achievements are stackable (e.g. earning an achievement on Hardestcore Mode would also earn the equivalent achievements for Mediumcore/Hardcore). However, it is recommended to work your way up if you are a newer player.
