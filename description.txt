Adds achievements for player difficulties to the in-game list.

Additions
Hardestcore is a new difficulty that is enabled when the following conditions are satisfied:
- Using a Hardcore player that was created with this mod enabled.
- Using a Hardcore player that hasn't visited any other worlds.
- Using a Hardcore player that has not died before.
- Playing in a world that was created with this mod enabled.
- Playing in a world that has not been visited by a non-Hardcore player.
- Playing in a world that a Hardcore player has not died in.

Restrictions
- Enforced Progression (e.g. you can't use post-Moon Lord items before defeating Moon Lord, etc.)
- No Journey Mode
- No Celebrationmk10 Seed

Notes
Achievements are stackable (e.g. earning an achievement on Hardestcore would also earn the equivalent achievements for Mediumcore/Hardcore). However, it is recommended to work your way up if you are a newer player.
