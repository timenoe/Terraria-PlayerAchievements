# Terraria PlayerAchievements

Adds achievements for player difficulties to the in-game list.

Hardestcore is a new difficulty that is enabled when a Hardcore player is in a world that no player has died in. In other words, you can't create a new Hardcore player to continue in a world that you previously died in.

## Restrictions
- No Journey Mode
- No Celebrationmk10 Seed
- Enforced Progression (e.g. you can't use post-Moon Lord items before defeating Moon Lord, etc.)
